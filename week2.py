# 20 lines of comments

# works for me
# control + / is the shortcut for commenting a line 
# the home and end keys are good for maneuvering on a line
# this is awesome
# bit by bit I'm learning more of the syntax involved with python
# alt + up or down moves a line of code in that subsequent direction
# the openness of the language lends itself to creative minds
# I wonder, if one isn't accustomed to creativity how can it be learned?
# By practice of course
# taking time to critically think
# your motivations
# your intentions
# your influences
# and ultimately your end goal
# just a man and his thoughts
# then a man of action
# Will you also teach us of the ''' ''' triple single quotes comments?
# What about str literals, str variables, or passing str through a function?
# Perhaps those are best learned later or during self-study
# The possibilities are endless
